# Ledgerly

**Ledgerly** is a personal budgeting application that I'm developing as a learning project. The goal is to create a simple yet powerful tool for tracking expenses, managing budgets, and gaining financial insights. Over time, I plan to expand Ledgerly with new features, improve its functionality, and refine the user experience.

## Project Goals
- **Learn and experiment** with software development concepts, including web development, backend logic, and data management.
- **Expand functionality** gradually by adding new budgeting tools, analytics, and automation.
- **Improve performance and usability** as I refine my coding skills and explore better design choices.

## Planned Features
- âœ… Basic income and expense tracking
- âœ… Budget categories and limits
- ðŸ“Š Transaction history and analytics
- ðŸ”„ Data export and import options
- ðŸ“ˆ Visual reports and charts
- ðŸ”— Integration with external financial tools (long-term goal)
